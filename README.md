# MarvelCinematicUniversiveTriviaGame

A command line interface program that uses object oriented programming principles, conditional logic, and error checking for a user to take a 10 question trivia game on a specific MCU movie or televison show. The User is able to navigate the menu screen and test their knowledge on any MCU movie or television show. 

I also used StreamWriter and StreamReader to create an audit log of every game played and implemented a secret input to display the log. 

I also created a SQL Database and now a user can create an account and login into the account. 

I am leveraging a DAO pattern to save data to the SQL Database and pull data. 
  - A user's score is saved after completing the game. 

Future functions: 
  - A user being able to review there past games and scores
  - A user being able to see all the scores of a specific game (Including there score and other user scores
