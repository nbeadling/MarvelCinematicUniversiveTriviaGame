# MarvelCinematicUniversiveTriviaGame

A command line interface program that uses object oriented programming principles, conditional logic, and error checking for a user to take a 10 question trivia game on a specific MCU movie or televison show. The User is able to navigate the menu screen and test their knowledge on any MCU movie or television show. 

I also used StreamWriter and StreamReader to create an audit log of every game played and implemented a secret input to display the log.

  1. Iron Man
